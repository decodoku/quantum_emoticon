# Quantum Emoticon

The [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/decodoku/quantum_emoticon/blob/master/quantum_emoticon.ipynb) makes a smiley with a quantum computer. It is designed to be run when sitting in a subfolder of [qiskit-tutorial](https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-tutorial).

An explanation of what I did and why can be found [here](https://medium.com/@decodoku/making-a-quantum-computer-smile-cee86a6fc1de).

But you don't need to run it. Here's one I made earlier.
